# crypto-value
This simple Python script allows users to notify themselves of the value of their crypto wallets.

Edit the dictionary `coins` with the symbols for the cryptocurrencies you own and the number of coins you own. 

## For example:

coins = {"BTC":3.2, "ADA": 179.38}

This dictionary says you own 3.2 Bitcoin, and 179.38 ADA.
